This is a Maven project.  To build it with maven run 'mvn clean
install'.

It is also an Eclipse project and can be built from within Eclipse.
An easy way to generate the command-line utility is to export it as an
runnable jar file from within Eclipse.  To do that clone the git repo
and import it into Eclipse as a Maven project.  Then after building
it, export as a Java runnable jar.
